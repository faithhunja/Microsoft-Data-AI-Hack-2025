# üßæ Tax Automation System Using Document Intelligence

This documentation outlines the architecture, workflow, and analytics pipeline of a **Tax Automation System** that leverages Azure **Document Intelligence** to train a custom model for extracting key fields from **P9 forms**. It also integrates **Power BI and Fabric** for user analysis and visualization.

---

## üìÇ Azure Storage Accounts

We use two Azure Storage containers to manage and streamline the data flow:

Create an azure storage account, then create two containers as below

![Storage Account Creation](./demo-screenshots/storagecontainers.png)

### 1. `p9-forms` ‚Äì Training Data Source  
This storage account contains a curated dataset of P9 forms used to train the Document Intelligence custom model.

### 2. `p9-submissions` ‚Äì User Uploads  
This storage account is the entry point of the user workflow. Each uploaded form is stored here and used for **continuous training** to improve the model.

## ü§ñ Document Intelligence Model

The custom model is trained to extract key fields like:

- Taxpayer PIN  
- Employer Details  
- Gross Pay  
- PAYE Paid  
- Reliefs Claimed

### Model Training & Deployment

The model is trained using forms stored in `p9-forms` and deployed with a REST endpoint for inference.

2. create a new custom extraction project

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Workflow

The flow from user upload to prefilled Excel generation:

1. **User Uploads P9 Form**  
   Form is uploaded via the frontend and stored in `p9-submissions`.

2. **Form Processed by Model**  
   App triggers the Document Intelligence model endpoint to extract data fields.

3. **Generate Prefilled Excel**  
   Extracted data is formatted into a structured Excel sheet.

4. **User Reviews and Downloads**  
   The user verifies the details and downloads the Excel sheet for **KRA submission**.

## üìä Fabric + Power BI Integration

To demonstrate downstream analytics, we simulate user data.Due to limited real P9 data access. This simulation mimics data from actual extractions and helps visualize:

- Unique Taxpayer PINs  
- Frequency of Filing Errors  
- Estimated Compliance Rates

### Sample user data:
```bash
[
    {
      "employee_name": "John Mwangi Kariuki",
      "employee_number": "10234",
      "id_number": "30125478",
      "kra_pin": "A001567890W",
      "taxable_pay": 50000.00,
      "total_mpr": 2400.00,
      "total_paye": 8000.00
    },
    {
      "employee_name": "Amina Halima Hassan",
      "employee_number": "20987",
      "id_number": "30256987",
      "kra_pin": "A003789456X",
      "taxable_pay": 85000.00,
      "total_mpr": 2400.00,
      "total_paye": 13600.00
    },
    {
      "employee_name": "Peter Njuguna Wanjohi",
      "employee_number": "15045",
      "id_number": "20458790",
      "kra_pin": "A004123678Y",
      "taxable_pay": 30000.00,
      "total_mpr": 2400.00,
      "total_paye": 4000.00
    }
  ]
```

This analysis can organizations track their PAYE submissions to KRA for log audits. Other functionalities include tax based reports such as average Payable income, PAYE, etc.
